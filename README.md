# ChatBot

History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: Eliza.

This is a simple chatbot program that uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to provide responses to user input.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the chatbot program:

## Usage
